This session expands on classes and objects and focuses on inheritance. 
The child class(derived/subclass) inherits parent class (baseclass/ superclass) attrutes and methods.
Besides inheriting parent's attributes and methods, the child class can have it's own attributes and methods.
There are 3 types of inheritance:
(i) Single inheritance 
(ii) Multiple iheritance 
(iii)Multi-level inheritance
